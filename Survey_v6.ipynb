Jupyter Notebook makes this more convenient by allowing me combine simulation and analysis in a single notebook without the intermediate step of saving text files and reading the data again. However, this also makes it much easier to \"lose\" results that only ever existed as data, but were not written to files. Going back to writing text files for all of the possibly interesting output would be a step back regarding the interactivity, so an easy way to save program state or something similar would be great.

      "Constrains: 'It's starting to become a regular tool. I run the notebook server on a VPS and use the notebook through SSH. I run the notebook server on code in a Git master branch and I sync that with a local branch periodically. I have mostly just used Idle in the past because that is very flexible and I get a complete transcript of my programming session. But support for Idle and improvements to Idle have mostly stopped. I like the general idea of the notebook but the format doesn't support some things very well - testing for example. I would like to have my tests in a separate notebook that is linked to the one I'm currently developing (same kernel I guess). I would like my tests to be separate because if they are in the same notebook as my normal code then it is distracting. I could migrate out my tests to  a separate file, but then they are not in the same notebook format as the regular code which is very convenient.  Some things in Jupyter are frustrating: 1. the kernel cannot be reliably interrupted. 2. kernel crashes. This means that datasets must be reloaded which can take a long time in my case. 3. code is not reloaded easily: I have to manually use reload(module) if the code is in a file. The notebook should reliably reload modules: I realize that this is a long-standing problem in Python generally that has still not been resolved after all these years. 4. code reload in a cell is very buggy. I've had old code remain in a cell after making a change that has caused some strange results. A reload of the code in a cell should clean out all of the old definitions and variables in that cell so that there can't be any strange behaviour due to old references. ', score: 3\n",

      "Constrains: 'Interactive plot exploration (through matplotlib) is a bit clunky and much worse than in Matlab, for example. You basically need to modify the code that you used to create a plot and rerun its cell in order to modify the plot. Embedded plots are not interactive and regular matplotlib figures are not that dynamic to begin with. You can zoom and pan but you cannot modify them in any other way (e.g. you cannot select a plot element and modify its color, delete it or add a fitting curve as in Matlab). Some of these are limitations of matplotlib of course but that is part of the whole \"Jupyter package\".  Creating interactive plots and widgets is too complicated at the moment. It requires too much programming.  It is hard to generate a nice report that you can share with non technical people from a Jupyter notebook because there is no way (AFAIK) to hide the code cells from the output. It would be cool to be able to mark a cell as \"hidden code\" which would be excluded from the generated PDF for example.  The UI is a bit clunky and editing code is a bit painful when there is a lot of code in a cell.  Being able to run cells out of order is cool but it also makes it hard to reproduce what you did later. This makes it particularly hard to turn a notebook into a proper Python script sometimes. It would be great if you could somehow replay the notebook in the order that you executed it and export that in the proper order. Maybe there should be a way to programmatically execute a cell from another cell (maybe this is already possible and Injust don't know about it).', score: -9\n",

One thing which lets me prefer Spyder for my daily work is its context sensitive help, where or each command you type in a separate window a nicely typeset help text appears automatically. When using Scipy extensively, this is a real help.   For casual users like me, the number of key strokes and commands one needs to remember for efficient work is a burden. Extended tool bars (especially for Markdown) could flatten the learning curve quite a bit.

Furthermore, once it is ported to an external module, its essentially impossible to either bring the code back into the notebook efficiently (i.e., not just copying and pasting into cells) and or to maintain a coherent version control stream for the changes then made in the notebook. So currently software development in a notebook to external module is a 1-way street, and not a particularly easy one to navigate.   Also, inconsistency in relative import statements make developing software packages in a notebook/module. Given the portable nature of the notebook, it's nice to be able to work from the same source files on a variety of computers. But absolute paths can't be used across machines (unless they follow the same convention) and its not clear how one would specify the absolute path relative to the location of the notebook server and vs. notebook itself.

      "The usability in terms of keyboard-only usage could improve. I often have to utilize the mouse (eg. activate an input field). It would be great to get really good hints on what shortcuts are available that are visible during everyday use (eg. underlined characters in the menus) and not only when opening an extra cheat sheet (like it is today). You can only learn the shortcuts, if you see them regularly.  Additionally, the help integration for the programming language I'm using and also additional libs could get better. In times it's really frustrating to search for some function syntax. The SHIFT-TAB stuff is a good start, still I'd like get more and better layouted help. \n",
      "It is very easy to do exploratory computing, but not so easy to persist results. I work in computational quantum physics, and in my \"old\" workflows, e.g., with Fortran codes, the computation and analysis were usually well-separated: The results from (potentially long-running) simulations were saved as text files, and then analyzed/plotted with, e.g., gnuplot.  Jupyter Notebook makes this more convenient by allowing me combine simulation and analysis in a single notebook without the intermediate step of saving text files and reading the data again. However, this also makes it much easier to \"lose\" results that only ever existed as data, but were not written to files. Going back to writing text files for all of the possibly interesting output would be a step back regarding the interactivity, so an easy way to save program state or something similar would be great. I realize this is not directly within the scope of the Jupyter Notebook, as it corresponds to a general persistence solution for Python, but it's definitely a pain point that is made more relevant by the dynamic nature of the Notebook.\n",
      "I tried Jupyter for making some lecture slides for teaching statistical methods in Python. My main grievances were the lack of more advanced (code-) editor features like incremental searching and an outline view for better navigation (during presentation and writing). I am aware of plugins, which I unfortunately could not to get work seamlessly (in Anaconda).   One thing which lets me prefer Spyder for my daily work is its context sensitive help, where or each command you type in a separate window a nicely typeset help text appears automatically. When using Scipy extensively, this is a real help.   For casual users like me, the number of key strokes and commands one needs to remember for efficient work is a burden. Extended tool bars (especially for Markdown) could flatten the learning curve quite a bit.   Furthermore, typesetting advanced math is a bit cumbersome (especially when looking for typos which prevent rendering, integrating your own macros, equation cross referencing, etc). A better integration could replace LaTeX for many documentation tasks (as in technical reports).\n",
      "I can't apt-get install jupyter in Debian.  Using pip appears to pull large quantities of software from what amounts to another distribution. I know and trust Debian and the DFSG; I trust it to play well with upgrades.  If there's a simple semantic mismatch (like iPython vs jupyter), it's sure not obvious to me at first pass.  I'd love to use Jupyter, but it needs to fit into the reliable framework that's treated me well for the past 15 years.\n",
      "1. The integration of matplotlib could be better. E.g. resizing of a graph still does not trigger a redraw, and is not stored for the next run of this code cell.  2. A basic version of shared notebooks would be great. Of course, real time collaboration at one notebook would be best, but running notebooks on different machines, and tracking individual changes would be a great first step, thaat, I think, is much easier to realize, and  almost as helpful.  3. Some lightweight admin level for code cells (run, delete, move cell groups). Probably possible to combine this in a reasonable way with some structure of the notebook.\n",

Would also love an easy way to \"push\" code from cells to external files so they can be edited by an external text editor.

I've sometimes found it a little difficult maintaining a suite of notebooks that all rely on common code.\n",

      "Inability to run notebooks as first-class scripts. Sometimes I'll have a particular or analysis demoed or sketched in a Notebook; simply running the Notebook will be enough to produce the whole result that I care about. Because it's not easy to run Notebooks from terminal (like \"$ python my_notebook.ipynb\"), I end up having to convert them. But since in the process, I end up creating a normal script, I take the time to write a full shell script with argparse and other options in case I want to tweak the output later. That's all fine, but it would be really nice to just by able to run the notebook directly.  Additionally, first-class or native support for git-hooks would be nice, so that it's easier to track a notebook in version control.

      "Editing things is cumbersome - now I am used to vim and sublime shortcuts, I find myself missing them a lot.  Typically, the notebook has some quick ideas in it, which inevitably don't follow the best coding practices. So I often need to replace things, or edit all instances of a variable, etc - something that is hard (if not impossible) in the notebook.  Another problem is that notebooks can become cumbersome - but I guess this is more my poor planning/organisation than the notebook's fault!\n",

      "Interactive plot exploration (through matplotlib) is a bit clunky and much worse than in Matlab, for example. You basically need to modify the code that you used to create a plot and rerun its cell in order to modify the plot. Embedded plots are not interactive and regular matplotlib figures are not that dynamic to begin with. You can zoom and pan but you cannot modify them in any other way (e.g. you cannot select a plot element and modify its color, delete it or add a fitting curve as in Matlab). Some of these are limitations of matplotlib of course but that is part of the whole \"Jupyter package\".  Creating interactive plots and widgets is too complicated at the moment. It requires too much programming.  It is hard to generate a nice report that you can share with non technical people from a Jupyter notebook because there is no way (AFAIK) to hide the code cells from the output. It would be cool to be able to mark a cell as \"hidden code\" which would be excluded from the generated PDF for example.  The UI is a bit clunky and editing code is a bit painful when there is a lot of code in a cell.  Being able to run cells out of order is cool but it also makes it hard to reproduce what you did later. This makes it particularly hard to turn a notebook into a proper Python script sometimes. It would be great if you could somehow replay the notebook in the order that you executed it and export that in the proper order. Maybe there should be a way to programmatically execute a cell from another cell (maybe this is already possible and Injust don't know about it).\n"

      "It is very easy to do exploratory computing, but not so easy to persist results. I work in computational quantum physics, and in my \"old\" workflows, e.g., with Fortran codes, the computation and analysis were usually well-separated: The results from (potentially long-running) simulations were saved as text files, and then analyzed/plotted with, e.g., gnuplot.  Jupyter Notebook makes this more convenient by allowing me combine simulation and analysis in a single notebook without the intermediate step of saving text files and reading the data again. However, this also makes it much easier to \"lose\" results that only ever existed as data, but were not written to files. Going back to writing text files for all of the possibly interesting output would be a step back regarding the interactivity, so an easy way to save program state or something similar would be great. I realize this is not directly within the scope of the Jupyter Notebook, as it corresponds to a general persistence solution for Python, but it's definitely a pain point that is made more relevant by the dynamic nature of the Notebook.\n",
