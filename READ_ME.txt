*** ALL THE FILE WRITE BY JUPYTER NOTEBOOK ***
You can open this notebook in Anaconda, it will show the output of each cell.
If you haven't install any package, maybe run the cells after you install the package.

[Description]

* Survey_v1.ipynb -  Determine how many positive and negative comments in the 'What, if anything, hinders you from making Jupyter Notebook an even more regular part of your workflow?'

* Survey_v2.ipynb -  Find each positive, negative and neutral comments, make a label, then store in a dataframe

* Survey_v3.ipynb -  (the similar code I used in the document analysis project) compare the bigram and unigram classifier, show the accuracy of the prediction. (package from sklearn)

* Survey_v4.ipynb -  random split the dataframe into the training and testing dataset. Use SentiWordnet from nltk, also use nltk SentimentAnalyzer to see different accuracy.

NOTE:  since the dataset is random, so sometimes the accuracy is high, sometimes is relatively low. But the range is from 0.6 to 0.9 (can accept the model)
