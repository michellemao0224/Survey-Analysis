I work in computational quantum physics, and in my \"old\" workflows, e.g., with Fortran codes, the computation and analysis were usually well-separated: The results from (potentially long-running) simulations were saved as text files, and then analyzed/plotted with, e.g., gnuplot.  Jupyter Notebook makes this more convenient by allowing me combine simulation and analysis in a single notebook without the intermediate step of saving text files and reading the data again. However, this also makes it much easier to \"lose\" results that only ever existed as data, but were not written to files. Going back to writing text files for all of the possibly interesting output would be a step back regarding the interactivity, so an easy way to save program state or something similar would be great. I realize this is not directly within the scope of the Jupyter Notebook, as it corresponds to a general persistence solution for Python, but it's definitely a pain point that is made more relevant by the dynamic nature of the Notebook.', subject: function\n",

It can be tricky to scroll up and down and deal with large cells with lots of code.  It's difficult to run an IPython Notebook server that has support for both Py2 and Py3 kernels - ideally, there should be some way to integrate with conda so that you can easily start kernels in any conda environment.  Similarly, I often end up with multiple 'ipython notebook' commands (from the Terminal) running at once, as I want them to be in multiple different directories and in multiple conda environments. Combining this with the previous point: it'd be great if I could have it running as a service (or something similar), and then could just easily create a kernel from any conda environment, and navigate to the right folder - and have it all 'just work' without having to run new servers all the time', subject: function\n",

The namespace gets polluted from previously run cells even if those cells were later changed, resulting in hard-to-find bugs where I change a function name where it is defined in cell 1 but forget to change it where it is called in cell 2 and there is no apparent error, because cell 2 is silently calling the old function. I have taken to restarting the entire notebook and running every cell over again when I want to make a major change to a function, which is pretty slow. 2. When I am using parallel engines and something goes wrong I typically have to restart the engines and restart the notebook I'm working on, including running all the cells again (some kind of caching would help make this faster, like in R Notebooks).

I could migrate out my tests to  a separate file, but then they are not in the same notebook format as the regular code which is very convenient.  Some things in Jupyter are frustrating: 1. the kernel cannot be reliably interrupted. 2. kernel crashes. This means that datasets must be reloaded which can take a long time in my case. 3. code is not reloaded easily: I have to manually use reload(module) if the code is in a file. The notebook should reliably reload modules: I realize that this is a long-standing problem in Python generally that has still not been resolved after all these years. 4. code reload in a cell is very buggy. I've had old code remain in a cell after making a change that has caused some strange results. A reload of the code in a cell should clean out all of the old definitions and variables in that cell so that there can't be any strange behaviour due to old references. ', subject: function\n",

      "Comment: 'Interactive plot exploration (through matplotlib) is a bit clunky and much worse than in Matlab, for example. You basically need to modify the code that you used to create a plot and rerun its cell in order to modify the plot. Embedded plots are not interactive and regular matplotlib figures are not that dynamic to begin with. You can zoom and pan but you cannot modify them in any other way (e.g. you cannot select a plot element and modify its color, delete it or add a fitting curve as in Matlab). Some of these are limitations of matplotlib of course but that is part of the whole \"Jupyter package\".  Creating interactive plots and widgets is too complicated at the moment. It requires too much programming.  It is hard to generate a nice report that you can share with non technical people from a Jupyter notebook because there is no way (AFAIK) to hide the code cells from the output. It would be cool to be able to mark a cell as \"hidden code\" which would be excluded from the generated PDF for example.  The UI is a bit clunky and editing code is a bit painful when there is a lot of code in a cell.  Being able to run cells out of order is cool but it also makes it hard to reproduce what you did later. This makes it particularly hard to turn a notebook into a proper Python script sometimes. It would be great if you could somehow replay the notebook in the order that you executed it and export that in the proper order.

      "Comment: 'Inability to easily navigate within modules/structured code directories, so that I can develop my code simultaneously as a package/module and within a notebook. Prototyping in the notebook is great, but then making sure everything works appropriately when outside of the notebook environment is more difficult without a lot more infrastructure. Furthermore, once it is ported to an external module, its essentially impossible to either bring the code back into the notebook efficiently (i.e., not just copying and pasting into cells) and or to maintain a coherent version control stream for the changes then made in the notebook. So currently software development in a notebook to external module is a 1-way street, and not a particularly easy one to navigate.   Also, inconsistency in relative import statements make developing software packages in a notebook/module. Given the portable nature of the notebook, it's nice to be able to work from the same source files on a variety of computers. But absolute paths can't be used across machines (unless they follow the same convention) and its not clear how one would specify the absolute path relative to the location of the notebook server and vs. notebook itself.  Editing documentation in the notebook (especially with executable examples) would make it easier to jump between source code and explicit documentation. Linking a particular cell out to a particular docstring for a particular function/class/method would be great.', subject: function\n",
