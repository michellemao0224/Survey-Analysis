12,"It is very easy to do exploratory computing, but not so easy to persist results. I work in computational quantum physics, and in my ""old"" workflows, e.g., with Fortran codes, the computation and analysis were usually well-separated: The results from (potentially long-running) simulations were saved as text files, and then analyzed/plotted with, e.g., gnuplot.  Jupyter Notebook makes this more convenient by allowing me combine simulation and analysis in a single notebook without the intermediate step of saving text files and reading the data again. However, this also makes it much easier to ""lose"" results that only ever existed as data, but were not written to files. Going back to writing text files for all of the possibly interesting output would be a step back regarding the interactivity, so an easy way to save program state or something similar would be great. I realize this is not directly within the scope of the Jupyter Notebook, as it corresponds to a general persistence solution for Python, but it's definitely a pain point that is made more relevant by the dynamic nature of the Notebook.",function,positive

The notebook should reliably reload modules: I realize that this is a long-standing problem in Python generally that has still not been resolved after all these years. 4. code reload in a cell is very buggy.

You basically need to modify the code that you used to create a plot and rerun its cell in order to modify the plot. Embedded plots are not interactive and regular matplotlib figures are not that dynamic to begin with. You can zoom and pan but you cannot modify them in any other way (e.g. you cannot select a plot element and modify its color, delete it or add a fitting curve as in Matlab). Some of these are limitations of matplotlib of course but that is part of the whole ""Jupyter package"".  Creating interactive plots and widgets is too complicated at the moment. It requires too much programming.  It is hard to generate a nice report that you can share with non technical people from a Jupyter notebook because there is no way (AFAIK) to hide the code cells from the output. It would be cool to be able to mark a cell as ""hidden code"" which would be excluded from the generated PDF for example.  The UI is a bit clunky and editing code is a bit painful when there is a lot of code in a cell.  Being able to run cells out of order is cool but it also makes it hard to reproduce what you did later. This makes it particularly hard to turn a notebook into a proper Python script sometimes.

One thing which lets me prefer Spyder for my daily work is its context sensitive help, where or each command you type in a separate window a nicely typeset help text appears automatically. When using Scipy extensively, this is a real help.   For casual users like me, the number of key strokes and commands one needs to remember for efficient work is a burden. Extended tool bars (especially for Markdown) could flatten the learning curve quite a bit.

Furthermore, once it is ported to an external module, its essentially impossible to either bring the code back into the notebook efficiently (i.e., not just copying and pasting into cells) and or to maintain a coherent version control stream for the changes then made in the notebook. So currently software development in a notebook to external module is a 1-way street, and not a particularly easy one to navigate.   Also, inconsistency in relative import statements make developing software packages in a notebook/module. Given the portable nature of the notebook, it's nice to be able to work from the same source files on a variety of computers. But absolute paths can't be used across machines (unless they follow the same convention) and its not clear how one would specify the absolute path relative to the location of the notebook server and vs. notebook itself.
