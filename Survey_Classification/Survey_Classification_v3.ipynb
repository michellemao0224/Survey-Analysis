Jupyter Notebook makes this more convenient by allowing me combine simulation and analysis in a single notebook without the intermediate step of saving text files and reading the data again. However, this also makes it much easier to \"lose\" results that only ever existed as data, but were not written to files. Going back to writing text files for all of the possibly interesting output would be a step back regarding the interactivity, so an easy way to save program state or something similar would be great.

This also makes collaborating inside a single notebook challenging, because changes made by another person are not transparent.   I also use the notebook as a platform for distributing interactive demos for students (using the widgets!). This has been a great resource for getting simulation tools in the hands of students. However, at this point, the upstart for them is still tough. These students have no programming experience, and we are leveraging the notebook as a rapid way to build interactive simulations. If we could easily run them live on the web (not having to have students download, install python etc.) that would be huge! To lower the barriers even further, if we could easily hide the code and execute on startup (essentially using it as a gui), that would be nice. ', Subject: 'function', Comment: neutral \n",

      "Survey: 'Frankly, I'm not a fan of browser-based tools. Jupyter Notebooks are great for teaching, but I find that being browser-based is a huge hindrance for data exploration and exploratory programming.  In a nutshell, any web-based interface feels much slower than a similar console-based interface, and I personally think they slow down experimentation.  For that reason, I tend to use an IPython console extensively for day-to-day work and only use a Jupyter Notebook when I'm developing tutorials or similar documents.  Keep in mind that this is purely a personal preference.  Notebooks are a great communication tool, and Jupyter is an absolutely fabulous implementation, but they aren't a good fit for rapid experimentation, in my opinion.', Subject: 'function', Comment: positive \n",

The notebook should reliably reload modules: I realize that this is a long-standing problem in Python generally that has still not been resolved after all these years. 4. code reload in a cell is very buggy.

      "Survey: 'Interactive plot exploration (through matplotlib) is a bit clunky and much worse than in Matlab, for example. You basically need to modify the code that you used to create a plot and rerun its cell in order to modify the plot. Embedded plots are not interactive and regular matplotlib figures are not that dynamic to begin with. You can zoom and pan but you cannot modify them in any other way (e.g. you cannot select a plot element and modify its color, delete it or add a fitting curve as in Matlab). Some of these are limitations of matplotlib of course but that is part of the whole \"Jupyter package\".  Creating interactive plots and widgets is too complicated at the moment. It requires too much programming.  It is hard to generate a nice report that you can share with non technical people from a Jupyter notebook because there is no way (AFAIK) to hide the code cells from the output. It would be cool to be able to mark a cell as \"hidden code\" which would be excluded from the generated PDF for example.  The UI is a bit clunky and editing code is a bit painful when there is a lot of code in a cell.  Being able to run cells out of order is cool but it also makes it hard to reproduce what you did later. This makes it particularly hard to turn a notebook into a proper Python script sometimes. It would be great if you could somehow replay the notebook in the order that you executed it and export that in the proper order. Maybe there should be a way to programmatically execute a cell from another cell (maybe this is already possible and Injust don't know about it).', Subject: 'function', Comment: negative \n",
